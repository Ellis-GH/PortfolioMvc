A personal project to acquaint myself with .NET and web-development. An investment portfolio tracking website, primarily aiming to display YoY performance information that is sometimes missing from investment platforms.

Using the MVC architecture, wherein the server returns html pages to the client upon request. E.g 'Edit' returning the Edit Transaction page, which can then be filled in and posted back to the server.

Stock tickers can be updated with the latest prices, making use of the Alpha Vantage API. The number of requests that can be made is limited, for this project, which is tracked and displayed on the portfolio page. The rest of the data is managed by SQL Server.
